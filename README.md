The Tarnished's Chronicle is a desktop application for Windows designed for fans of the game Elden Ring who want to track their progress through the game in detail, especially in terms of defeated bosses. The application will not be a mere static list; its goal is to offer an interactive and visually appealing experience that will draw players in and motivate them to explore the Lands Between and overcome its challenges. Users will be able to track their progress in real time (or near real time) by monitoring their save file, see which bosses they have already defeated in each area, unlock achievements for milestones reached, and explore details about individual opponents.
