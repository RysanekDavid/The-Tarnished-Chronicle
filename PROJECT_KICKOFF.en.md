## Part 1: INTRODUCTION AND APPLICATION OVERVIEW

### Application Overview ("The Tarnished's Chronicle"):

"The Tarnished's Chronicle" is a desktop application for Windows designed for Elden Ring fans who want to meticulously track their game progress, especially concerning defeated bosses. This application won't just be a static list; its goal is to offer an **interactive and visually engaging experience** that immerses players and motivates them to explore the Lands Between and overcome its challenges. Users will be able to track their progress in real-time (or near real-time) by monitoring their save file, see which bosses they've already defeated in each area, unlock achievements for reaching milestones, and explore detailed information about individual adversaries. The entire interface will be designed with an emphasis on **"gamification" and user-friendliness**, making the application enjoyable and satisfying to use.

### Project Goal:

To create a robust and user-friendly desktop application that:

- **Automatically monitors the Elden Ring save file.**
- **Accurately detects and parses** the status of defeated bosses.
- **Displays player progress** in an interactive and gamified user interface.
- Offers **detailed information about bosses** and tracks achievements.
- Provides **"near real-time" updates** based on changes in the save file.

### Key Features (Extended):

- **Automatic monitoring of the Elden Ring save file** (ER0000.sl2 and potentially .co2 for Seamless Coop).
- **Parsing of relevant parts of the save file** to obtain the status of individual bosses.
- **Gamified User Interface (GUI):**
  - **Expandable Sections by Map Area:** Bosses grouped by in-game regions (Limgrave, Caelid, etc.) with checkboxes and visual progress indicators for each area.
  - **Achievements Panel:** For defeating all bosses in an area, specific groups of bosses, or reaching other milestones. Displayed with progress bars and rewards (e.g., stars, virtual trophies).
  - **Boss Detail on Click:** A dialog window with detailed information about the boss (description, lore background, known weaknesses, rewards for defeat, placeholder for image/artwork).
- **Option to select/manage game profiles** (characters).
- **Local storage and loading** of detected boss statuses and achievements per profile.
- **Distribution as an .exe installer.**

- **Language:** Python
- **GUI:** PySide6 (preferred due to LGPL license) or PyQt6
- **File Monitoring:** watchdog
- **Binary Data Parsing:** `struct` module, potentially Kaitai Struct
- **Application Data Storage:** JSON files

### Information Sources:
